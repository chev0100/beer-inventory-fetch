# Beer Store Order App

## Description
This app loads content from the beers endpoint of the Random Data API to build a Beer Menu Ordering interface. The user can add beers to their order, tallying how many of each kind they order and summing up the total price of their bill.

This exercise was coded and designed for students in the first semester of the Mobile Applications Design and Development program at Algonquin College.

## Branches
There is a branch called `w24-complete` that contains the completed exercise. Clone the app and switch to that branch to see the solution or switch to the starter branch to complete the exercise yourself.
